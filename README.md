# US Census Personal Income Prediction 

## Dataset 
This project uses a Dataset extracted from the 1194/95 US Census. 

This data was extracted by a third party from the census bureau database found at https://www.census.gov/data.html

The data was split into train/test in approximately 2/3, 1/3 roportions using MineSet's MIndUtil mineset-to-mlc.

Basic statistics for this data set:
  Number of instances for training data = 199523
  Duplicate or conflicting instances : 46716
  Number of instances in test = 99762
  Duplicate or conflicting instances : 20936

Labels were provided for personal income greater than or less than $50,000:

Probability for the label '< $50000' : 93.80%
Probability for the label > $50000' : 6.20%

Number of attributes/feeatures = 40 (continuous : 7 nominal : 33)

In brief the data consists of:
Demographic Information (Age, Sex, Race, etc.)
Employment Information (Worker type, Occupation, Employment Status, etc.)
Income Information (Capital Gains, Dividends, etc.)
Geographical Information (Region, State, Migration Data)
Family and Household Information (Marital Status, Family Size, etc.)
